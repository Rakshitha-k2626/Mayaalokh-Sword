🚀 Alien Detection Game – Beam vs Invaders
 🔧 Built with Python and Tkinter
I developed an interactive keyboard-controlled space defense game using Python’s tkinter module, where the player uses a vertical laser beam to catch falling aliens and destroy incoming asteroids. This project sharpened my GUI development, game logic, and event handling skills while creating an engaging user experience.
🌟 Key Features:
🎮 Keyboard-Only Controls – Move beam with ← → arrows, catch aliens using the Spacebar
👾 20 Alien Targets – Catch all before one hits Earth to win
💥 Asteroids – Auto-destroyed when touched by the beam
📈 Real-Time Scoring & Multiplier – Increases with faster alien captures
🌌 Starfield & Earth Graphics – Immersive space-themed visuals
🔚 Game Over Conditions – One alien reaching Earth ends the game
This was completed as part of my mini-project initiative, with future plans to integrate:
Sound effects
Image-based sprites
AI-powered alien movement
Leaderboards and difficulty levels
🧠 It was a fun way to combine game design, logic building, and visual programming into one cohesive Python project!
